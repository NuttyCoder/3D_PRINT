########################### INFO ON SENSORS #########################################################
# To measure water quality with a Raspberry Pi, you'll need sensors for parameters like pH, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, and temperature, along with a Raspberry Pi and some connecting hardware. 
# Here's a breakdown of common sensors and their applications:
# ----   pH Sensor: Measures the acidity or alkalinity of the water. 
#  ----- Electrical Conductivity (EC) Sensor: Indicates the concentration of dissolved salts and other ions. 
# -----  Dissolved Oxygen (DO) Sensor: Measures the amount of oxygen dissolved in the water. 
# ------ Turbidity Sensor: Measures the cloudiness or haziness of the water, indicating the presence of suspended particles. 
# ------ Temperature Sensor: Measures the water temperature, which can affect other water quality parameters. 
# ------- Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) Sensor: Measures the combined content of all inorganic and organic substances dissolved in water. 
#  Here's a more detailed explanation:
# pH:
# A pH sensor measures the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in the water, expressed on a scale of 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. 
# EC/TDS:
# EC sensors measure the ability of water to conduct electricity, which is related to the concentration of dissolved ions. TDS sensors measure the total amount of dissolved solids in water, which can include both organic and inorganic substances. 
# DO:
# DO sensors measure the amount of oxygen dissolved in the water, which is essential for aquatic life. 
# Turbidity:
# Turbidity sensors measure the light-scattering ability of the water, which is an indicator of the amount of suspended particles. 
# Temperature:
# Temperature sensors measure the water temperature, which can affect the solubility of gases and the activity of microorganisms.
