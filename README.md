3d Printing files and Hydroponics Farming
This is a Personel Project with Tech and Hydroponics

1. Define the Components
Key Features:
A Graphical User Interface
Real-Time water intake control
Sensors to monitor Temperature and Humidity
Continous Water Quality Analysis
Rolling Database to log data(date, time, and all the key metrics

Tools and Libraries:
GUI Use Tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy
Hardware Intergration: Use libraries RPi.GRIO ( for Raspberry Pi) serial (for (Audrino), or pyModbus
Database: Use SQLite or MySQL for a lighweight and reliable database

2. Structure the Project
Modules:

GUI Module: Design a user-friendly interface (simple, reliable)
Sensor Module: Communicate with sensors for data collection
Control Module: Regulate water flow, temperature, and humidity
Database Module: Log data efficently with timestamping

Advance Features:
Real-Time Updates: Use threading to continuosly update the GUI with Sensor Data
Notification System: Add alerts for abnormal conditions(e.g., pH Balance)
Historical data: Display graphs using matplotlib to analyze trends over time

Hardware Intergration
Utilize microcontrollers like Arduino or Raspberry Pi for sensor and actuator management.
Integrate compatible sensors (e.g., DHT11/DHT22 for temperature and humidity, pH sensors for water quality).

Testing and Optimization
Simulate the sensors and database during development.
Test on small-scale hardware before full deployment.
Ensure the database is efficient for long-term usage.
